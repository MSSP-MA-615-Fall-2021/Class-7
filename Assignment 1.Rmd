## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #Pull up the function we will use
data(mtcars) # Select the data 
mtcars_mpg2 <- mtcars[mtcars$mpg <20,] # Select the data for mpg < 20

mtcars_mpg2 <- mtcars_mpg2[, c(1,2,3,4,10)] # Select column from mtcars_mpg2 in 1, 2, 3, 4, 10

source(file = "hand_functions.R", echo = TRUE) # Use the function create by R. Scrip

sp_out <- sum_special(mtcars_mpg2) # Name the data in different way
```

```{r}
#### Plot the data with x = disp, y = mpg by using geom_point() and create a smooth line for the entire data. 
ggplot(mtcars_mpg2) +
  aes(x = disp, y = mpg) +
  geom_point(shape = "bullet", size = 4L, colour = "#B22222") +
  geom_smooth(span = 0.5) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# note that this boxplot cannot be made with esquisse() unless
# the data is adjusted.  What adjustment is needed?
```{r}
ggplot(mtcars_mpg2, aes(x=as.factor(cyl), y=mpg)) + 
  geom_boxplot(fill="slateblue", alpha=0.2) + 
  xlab("cyl")

```

By factoring cyl we change the data from a vector to a factor, then we can use factor data to create a boxlpot.

What I learned from this class is to use esquisser(data = mtcars_mpg2, viewer = "browser") to create a plot and get in touch with tidyverse. In addition, to understand how to change shape in ggplot function.
